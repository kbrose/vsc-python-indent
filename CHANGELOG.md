### 1.17.0

* Fix dedent logic when the dedent keyword is preceded by a multi-line indent keyword

### 1.16.0

* Correctly delete selected text starting with space (fixes [#96](https://github.com/kbrose/vsc-python-indent/issues/96))

### 1.15.0

* Update CI system to use Node v16
* Update minimum compatible VSC version to 1.65
* Update development dependencies, including migrating linting from tslint to eslint
* State the name of the theme used in the demo gif

### 1.14.2

* Fixes changelog - I mislabeled several releases.

### 1.14.1

* Handles neovim mode in a similar way to vim mode.
* Fix innacuracy in README around comment-line continuation.

### 1.14.0

* Update CI system to use Node v10.
* Add GitHub Sponsors information

### 1.13.1

* Fix link in readme

### 1.13.0

* This extension has been installed half a million times. That's pretty cool.
* Added dontation link.
* Updated development-only dependency `y18n`.
* Refactored code to make it more testable.

### 1.12.0

* Updated required vscode version to 1.50 (September 2020 release)
* Whitespace to the right of the cursor will now be deleted when pressing `Enter`. This only happens when there are non-whitespace characters to the left and to the right of the cursor, e.g. as in the case `def f(x,| y)` (where `|` is the cursor) but not in the case `    |print(x)` or `print(x)|  `. See [the issue](https://github.com/kbrose/vsc-python-indent/issues/62) for more information.

### 1.11.0

* Add option to control whether hanging indents put the bracket on its own line or not.

### 1.10.1

* Update README to showcase new setting `trimLinesWithOnlyWhitespace`.

### 1.10.0

* Lines that contain only whitespace can be trimmed after pressing `Enter` using the new `trimLinesWithOnlyWhitespace` setting. This defaults to `false`, i.e. lines are _not_ trimmed. The new behavior more closely matches the native VSCode behavior. See [issue 60](https://github.com/kbrose/vsc-python-indent/issues/60) for a more complete discussion of the native behavior.
* Update development dependencies to handle various deprecations and migrations. This has no effect on the dependencies needed to _run_ the extension, just _develop_ it.

### 1.9.0

The access token I use to publish this extension expired, which meant this version didn't get pushed. However, it still incremented the version number. `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

### 1.8.1

* Also handle `while...else`.

### 1.8.0

* Update dedent logic to handle `for...else` and `try...else` constructs.

### 1.7.0

* Scroll the window when pressing `Enter` near the bottom of the window/out of view.

### 1.6.1

* Bump `python-indent-parser` version

### 1.6.0

* Fix incorrect indentation when pressing enter on lines with an open bracket, but no closing bracket.
* Switch to centralized python parsing library shared by the `python-indent` package for Atom (thanks @DSpeckhals)

### 1.5.0

* If your cursor is in the middle of a comment when you press `Enter`, then the next line is auto-commented as well.
* Small updates to README

### 1.4.0

* Better dedentation handling of `else:` and similar keywords.

### 1.3.0

* Indent the next line if you use a backslash to do a line continuation.

### 1.2.0

* Fix unexpected dedenting when you have variables named like `return_this_value`.

* The extension now works if text is highlighted when the user presses Enter. Thanks @WhistleWhileYouWork!

* Update demo gif to showcase improved dedent behaviors.
