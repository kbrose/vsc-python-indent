**Minimal code example:**

What the code looks like before pressing `enter`:

```python
def my_example():
    pass|  # Use "|" to show where the cursor is. Keep your code nice and short!
```

What I want the code to look like after pressing `enter`:

```python
def my_example():
    pass
|
```

What the code actually looks like after pressing `enter`:

```python
def my_example():
    pass
    |
```
